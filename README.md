Ethercode
=========

Live coding with friends in Etherpad: <http://www.screenr.com/2xps>.

## Setup

* `bundle`
* `bundle exec camping app.rb`
* Visit <http://localhost:3301/> and drag the bookmarklet to your toolbar.
* Create an Etherpad on a server (e.g. <http://ietherpad.com/>)
* Click the bookmarklet!

Your browser is now working as a code runner and presenter. Connect it
to a projector and hack together with your friends.

(NOTE: You must open the tab in a new browser/session if you also want
to write)
